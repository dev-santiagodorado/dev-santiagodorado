## About Me
Junior Full Stack Developer with experience in end-to-end web application development, skilled in handling both backend logic and frontend interaction. Proficient in developing RESTful APIs using Java and Spring Boot, applying design principles such as SOLID, Clean Code, and layered architecture to ensure maintainability, scalability, and best development practices.

On the frontend side, works with Angular and TypeScript to build interactive, accessible, and well-structured interfaces with seamless integration to backend services. Experienced in working with PostgreSQL and MongoDB databases, understanding persistence patterns and efficient schema design.

Familiar with professional development and deployment environments, including the use of Docker for containerization, Git for version control, and GitHub for collaborative code management. Fluent in agile environments, utilizing tools such as Jira and Trello for task planning and workflow management. Additionally, employs Figma to interpret UI/UX designs and translate them into functional components.

Currently seeking an internship opportunity (FCT) to join real development teams, contribute from day one, and continue strengthening technical skills in professional settings.
